Very Last okay.
I only rember how I encrypted it and the output was
Encrypted output: 383c3b3f343137373c3539343c3430353b3e



I have very blurry memory:

-ROT14/15/16 → Base64 → Hex → Shift each byte +3 -> 383c3b3f343137373c3539343c3430353b3e

maybe reversing pattern may help. ASK GPT hehe Byeee.......
